## Templates

The `template/` directory contains templates for use in creating new
repositories, including:

- a `.gitattributes` file with common settings.
- a `.gitignore` file with common exclusions.
- a `LICENSE.md` template.
- a `phpcs.xml` file with coding standard configuration.
- a `phpunit.xml.dist` file with PHPUnit configuration.

Templates all use the same placeholders, which can be replaced en masse:

- `{year}` is the year of first publication, or a range of years from first
  publication until most recent update.
- `{org}` refers to the github organization under which the package will live.
- `{repo}` is the name of the repository.
